##  CS50P — Introduction to Programming with Python

Welcome to my CS50P repository — a complete collection of weekly problem sets and projects from Harvard’s Introduction to Programming with Python.
All solutions were developed and tested using the official CS50 Duck IDE environment. 💻

---

##  Overview

This repository contains my personal implementations of the weekly assignments from the CS50P course.
Each folder represents one week of the curriculum and includes exercises, problem sets, and sometimes additional notes or test files.
All code was written and tested in CS50 Duck IDE to ensure full compatibility with tools like check50, submit50, and style50.
